    "This project is aimed to explore and suggest the best regions for people who want to start a vending machines business in Boston(US). In retail, the most important contributor to success is location. Usually, business owners want their machines in places that have plenty of foot traffic, such as malls, large office complexes, schools, airports, in front of stores, etc. \n",
